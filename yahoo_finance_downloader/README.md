# About

Some guy on some discord wanted some data, so we whipped this up on a tuesday night. Saving here for re-use.

# Setup

1. Install pip
2. Install pipenv
3. clone repo/folder
4. From shell run:
```sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
$ cd yahoo_finance_downloader
```
# Use

Change the paramters on lines 10-13 to suit your needs. It might be possible to use timestampes for start and end to get live data, but not sure yet. Execute with: 

```bash
$ python yahoo.py
```
